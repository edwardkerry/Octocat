Explain what git clone does, in your own words:
git clone creates a replica of an existing repository, including the full history, branches, mergers etc.
Repositories can be cloned remotely, such as from gitHub or another user, as well as locally.
The syntax would be git clone <location of existing repository> <desired location of cloned repo>
