Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words:
The upstream remote is the remote repository that a working repository is cloned from, or information is pulled from.
Changes made to files, when committed, are then pushed back to the upstream repository.
In the case of the Octocat challenge, the github repository is the upstream remote.
