Explain what a branch is, in your own words:
In git, a branch is a sideline from the master workflow. 
It allows files to be edited and adjusted without interfering with the core functionality. Further features can be developed independetally.
Any staging or commiting is kept within the branch, distinct from the master "trunk". 
When ready, branches can be merged with the master to unite the two workstreams.
